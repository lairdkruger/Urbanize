# Urbanize Real-Time Sound Visualizer
see demo at: https://lairdkruger.github.io/Urbanize/

- a powerful computer (CPU) is recommended to minimise latency between the sound and the visuals
- an external microphone is also recommended to maximise the input sound quality
- be sure to refresh the page sometimes (this is not needed if the music is normalised)
